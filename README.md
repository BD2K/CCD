The Center for Causal Discovery (CCD) aims to:
<ul>
  <li>Develop highly efficient causal discovery algorithms that can be practically applied to very large biomedical datasets</li>
  <li>Conduct projects addressing 3 distinct biomedical questions (cancer driver mutations, lung fibrosis, brain causome) as a 
    vehicle for algorithm development and optimization</li>
  <li>Disseminate causal discovery algorithms, software, and tools</li>
  <li>Train data scientists and biomedical investigators in the use of CCD tools</li>
  <li>Train data scientists and biomedical investigators to collaborate in the discovery of causality.</li>
</ul>
